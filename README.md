# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

The HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor challenge focused on the skill of code refactoring. During this challenge, we were provided with starter html and css codes that we were tasked to refactor and optimize for accessibility. I changed as many tags to be semantic as possible and then updated the corresponding stylesheet to reflect the changes. I consolidated multiple styling sets to result in fewer duplications and reordered the stylesheet to more closely align with the flow of the updated semantic tags.

## User Story (provided)

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria (provided)

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up (provided)

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

## Grading Requirements (provided)

> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria: 

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40% (provided)

* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following code improvements:

  * Application's links all function correctly.

  * Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.

  * Application's CSS file is properly commented.

### Deployment: 32% (provided)

* Application deployed at live URL.

* Application loads with no errors.

* Application GitHub URL submitted.

* GitHub repository contains application code.

### Application Quality: 15% (provided)

* Application resembles mock-up provided in the Challenge instructions (at least 90%).

### Repository Quality: 13% (provided)

* Repository has a unique name.

* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

* Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

## Review (provided)

I am required to submit the following for review:

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README that describes the project.
